    "keywords": "SKConfettiView The confetti view is a container for one or more systems of particles. Top + Stream Center + Burst Sides + Multiple Properties The main property of a confetti view is the Systems property: Property Type Description Systems SKConfettiSystemCollection The collection of systems in the view. IsRunning bool Controls whether the all systems are running or not. IsComplete bool A value that indicates whether all systems are complete. Parts In addition to the properties on the view and all the systems, there is the overall control template that can directly influence the visual appearance of the view. The default template is defined as: <ControlTemplate x:Key=\"SKConfettiViewControlTemplate\"> <skia:SKCanvasView x:Name=\"PART_DrawingSurface\" /> </ControlTemplate> Part Description PART_DrawingSurface This part can either be a SKCanvasView or a SKGLView and describes the actual rendering surface for the confetti. System Every confetti view consists up one or more systems ( SKConfettiSystem ). Each system is a container for an emitter ( SKConfettiEmitter ) along with many properties on how the system runs. Property Type Description Emitter SKConfettiEmitter An emitter controls how the confetti particles are generated and at what rate for how long. EmitterBounds SKConfettiEmitterBounds The emitter bounds controls where in the view the particles appear. This can be from a side (left, right, top, bottom), a point or a rectangular region. Gravity Point The gravity is a acceleration vector that indicates the direction and strength of the gravity in the system. Colors SKConfettiColorCollection A collection of Color instances that determine the available colors for the confetti. Physics SKConfettiPhysicsCollection A collection of SKConfettiPhysics instances that determine the \"base\" mass and size of each confetti particle. Shapes SKConfettiShapeCollection A collection of SKConfettiShape instances that determine what each confetti particle looks like. StartAngle double The angle (in degrees) to form the start of the emission region. EndAngle double The angle (in degrees) to form the end of the emission region. MinimumInitialVelocity double The minimum initial velocity of the confetti particles. MaximumInitialVelocity double The maximum initial velocity of the confetti particles. MinimumRotationVelocity double The minimum initial rotation velocity of the confetti particles. MaximumRotationVelocity double The maximum initial rotation velocity of the confetti particles. MaximumVelocity double The maximum velocity the confetti particle can reach. FadeOut bool Whether or not the particle should fade out at the end of its life. Lifetime double The duration in seconds for how long the particle is allowed to live. IsRunning bool Controls whether the system is running or not. IsComplete bool A value that indicates whether the system is complete and all systems and particles are also complete. Emitter Each system has an emitter instance that controls how the confetti particles are generated and at what rate for how long. Property Type Description ParticleRate int The number of particles to generate each second. MaxParticles int The maximum number of particles allowed by the emitter. A value of -1 indicates no limit. Duration double The duration in seconds of how long the emitter runs for. A value of 0 indicates that all particles are emitted instantly. IsComplete bool A value that indicates whether the emitter has generated all the particles and they have all disappeared. Helper Emitters To make creating emitters easier, there are a few static helper methods on the SKConfettiEmitter type: Property Description Burst Create an emitter that generates the specified number of the particles instantly. Infinite Create an emitter that releases the specified number of particles each second. Stream Create an emitter that releases the specified number of particles for the specified amount of time. Shapes There are several simple types of \"shapes\" that the confetti can come in: Name Type Description Circle SKConfettiCircleShape This is a simple circle shape. Square SKConfettiSquareShape This is a simple square with equal length sides. Oval SKConfettiOvalShape This is the stretched circle or ellipse shape. This has a useful property HeightRatio that can be used to control the width/height ratio in the range of [0..1]. Rectangle SKConfettiRectShape This is a rectangle. This has a useful property HeightRatio that can be used to control the width/height ratio in the range of [0..1]. Advanced Shapes In addition to those, there is also a way to have custom paths as a shape: Name Type Description Paths SKConfettiPathShape This is a generic shape that supports any SKPath instance Custom SKConfettiShape This is the base type for shapes. Custom drawing code can be used by deriving from this type and overriding the OnDraw method. When making a custom shape, the instance is re-used, so all state needs to be set before drawing. The provided SKPaint instance is reset, so any properties set needs to be re-set. Custom Shapes public class ConfettiStar : SKConfettiShape { private readonly int points; public ConfettiStar(int points) { this.points = points; } protected override void OnDraw(SKCanvas canvas, SKPaint paint, float size) { using var star = SKGeometry.CreateRegularStarPath(size, size / 2, points); canvas.DrawPath(star, paint); } } Physics Each particle can have a size and mass, and the emitter can select one of them randomly: Property Type Description Mass double The mass of the particle which resists the force of gravity. Size double The physical size of the particle rendered."
